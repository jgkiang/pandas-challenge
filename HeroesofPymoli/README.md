Here are the 3 trends I've noticed in "Heroes of Pymoli":

1) The majority of players are male (84%) and age 20-24 (45%)
2) Males and females make the same amount of purchases (4 per person) and they spend roughly the same amount, too (around $3 per purchase)
3) Age doesn't seem to affect the purchases made either. The average purchase price is around $3 in all age groups with average purchases per person fluctuating between 3 and 4.
